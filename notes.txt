* in a commit early this evening, ~11pm, i successfully got sound to stream on ECS env without coturn (stun server used)
* but it only streamed once. after stopping, i could not start again
* the stun server seems to be dying without explanation, likely due to some interaction with the webrtc or scsynth being stopped or started again?
* debugging this is hard...
