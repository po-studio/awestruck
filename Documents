# Welcome to Awestruck
Awestruck is a platform for real-time generative music, enabling API-driven synthesis and synchronized audio streaming.

## About
Awestruck melds several technologies to enable on-demand synthesizers, streamed straight to your browser or app:
- SuperCollider for sound synthesis
- JACK for audio routing
- GStreamer for audio streaming
- WebRTC for real-time communication
- Docker for containerization
- CDKTF for infrastructure as code
- AWS for cloud services

## Goals
1. Infinitely scalable audio sessions, which:
- Start an scsynth and stream its output to the client instantly
- Stop when the user explicitly stops or closes their browser window
- Allow more than one client to connect to the same session
- Allow any number of users to start a new synthesis stream

2. [todo]
